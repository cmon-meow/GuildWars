~GWDatExtractor.exe~

I modified GWDatBrowser.exe to mass extract files.
VS2019 didn't like some older code, rather than fix it, I removed it.
To use: place gw.dat in same folder/directory as GWDatExtractor with bass.dll.
Warning!: Files will be extracted in the same filder/directory.


These tools I aquired years ago, don't know where I found them, if they've improved, or who to give thanks.
